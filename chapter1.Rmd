### Some thoughts

Never thought that I was actually going to do stuff in R. Up until now, I have done most of my work in Python.
I feel excited, but at the same time a bit worried that this will be very much work. Everything will probably be alright, and I will have gained
a lot of useful knowledge by the end of this course.

I found this course while desperately looking for the final study credits that I need to finish my doctoral studies. I have had plenty of struggle
trying to find something that actually seems useful for my future. This just might be it.
